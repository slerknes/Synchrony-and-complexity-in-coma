# Complementary roles of neural synchrony and complexity for indexing consciousness and chances of surviving in acute coma
Scripts for analyzing Phase-Locking Value and Lempel-Ziv Complexity, see:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118638

The scripts supports calculating the PLV and LZ complexity, identifying differences between groups on electrode- or electrode-pair level, identifying thresholds to split groups, and validating the tresholds in a separate sample. Also included are scripts to plot the results.
